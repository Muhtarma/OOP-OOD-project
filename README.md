IV1350 Object-Oriented Design — Seminar Project

This repository contains my Object-Oriented Design (IV1350) course project developed in Java as part of the Computer Engineering (Datorteknik) curriculum at KTH.  ￼

The code implements an object-oriented solution to the seminar tasks, following core OOP principles such as:
	•	Encapsulation — keeping data and behavior together
	•	Abstraction — defining clear interfaces
	•	Low coupling & high cohesion — modules with focused responsibilities
	•	Use of classes and objects to model the problem domain

🧠 What This Project Is

This project was developed for one of the seminars in the IV1350 course, where the goal was to:
	•	Translate an OOD model into working Java code.
	•	Use appropriate classes, methods, and relationships between objects.
	•	Apply object-oriented design principles effectively.

  🚀 How to Run
	1.	Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/Muhtarma/<repository-name>.git.
  2.	Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code).
	3.	Compile and run the main class.
